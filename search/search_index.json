The first user from the organization sets up an account and has the ability to invite other people to his organization and can be assigned a role ( Owner , Write and Read ). Each invited user will be part of the organization they are invited to and they can also join a default organization of his own, so they can explore Soluble on their own. Invite user Under settings , press Users . Under the Users, press Invite . Provide the email address of the person whom you would like to invite to your organization and select a role from the dropdown. User roles explained below. Press Invite Roles Each user role is specific to that particular organization where it was applied. Owner - The user who created the initial account for the organization is the Owner. The Owner will have access to all the functionalities in that particular organization. They have the permission to grant / revoke permissions to the other users in the organization. Write - The user has the permissions for reading and writing any entities in the organization except for Users and Billing . Read - The user has permissions to read anything in the organization. Tokens Soluble Tokens are of two types: Access tokens - These are used for integrating Soluble with other party tools, such as Soluble CLI etc. Agent tokens - These are used by Soluble agents deployed in Kubernetes clusters. Generating Access token To generate an access token Under Settings , press Tokens . Under the access tokens, click on Generate Access Token . Agent Tokens All the agent tokens used by Soluble agents for kubernetes should be visible under the Agent tokens. Token Management Any user with the right permissions will be able to Disable or Revoke tokens. Organization Setup The owner of the organization can configure the Organization settings, like the display name of the organization, Login provider for organization. Organization ID is provided by the Soluble itself, and users are not able to edit them. Alerts Alerts provide an easy way to handle any issues identified by the Soluble Fusion platform. Alerts can be created for the failed findings from the assessments from a finding's action Soluble, when integrated with other third party platforms like Slack, Jira., provides an easy way to manage the security / configuration issues identified by Soluble, and automates Jira ticket creation with just a click of a button and Slack notification. Dashboard The Soluble dashboard provides an easy way for tracking, analyzing and displaying key information, which helps you to monitor the security / configuration issues in your infrastructure. Integrations Soluble provides an easy way to integrate with third party tools like Slack Jira AWS kubernetes To integrate with the above tools, click on the Integrations sidebar navigation.

It can be used locally to run assessments and manage your account. It is used in your CI environment to run assessments and report the results to Soluble Fusion. Installation Mac OS The easiest way to install the CLI for MacOS is to use homebrew : brew install soluble-ai/soluble/soluble-cli To upgrade to the latest version: brew upgrade soluble-ai/soluble/soluble-cli Note: Due to Apple's notarization requirements, the brew installation builds the CLI from source. If this is a problem, you can download a precompiled binary from the GitHub Release page . However, you will have to approve it in Apple Preferences. We are working on distributing an Apple-notarized executable. Linux On Linux, run: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soluble-ai/soluble-cli/master/linux-install.sh | sh This will install the latest version in the current directory. You will need to move it to an appropriate location on your PATH . Precompiled binaries are also available on the Github Release page . Windows Precompiled binaries are available on GitHub Release page . Please note that our testing on Windows is minimal. Please file a GitHub issue if your run into any problems. Build from source Build From Source It's possible to build from source. Assuming you have go installed: git checkout https://github.com/soluble-ai/soluble-cli.git ./hack/build.sh ./soluble version CLI Authentication Integrated Authentication The CLI uses an OAuth flow with your browser to generate an authentication token and configuration. $ soluble login This will open a browser window and walk you through the authentication flow. If you are running the CLI in an environment that does not have access to a browser (i.e. in SSH or interactive container sesssion) you run the auth process in headless mode, with: $ soluble login --headless This will give you a link to copy/paste into your browser. When you have completed the authentication flow, you will copy/paste the authentication code back to the CLI to complete the authentication flow. Manually Obtianing Access Token If you run into problems with the procedure above, you can obtian an access token manaully. Log in to the UI and go to Access Tokens .
