## Step 1: Log In To Soluble Fusion

This is fast and simple using your Google or GitHub account:

-  Open a browser to [https://app.soluble.cloud](https://app.soluble.cloud)

-  Click [Create Account](https://app.soluble.cloud/register)
-  Select Google or GitHub indentity providers _(let us know if you'd like to see other identity providers)_
-  Select your account
-  Agree to Terms of Service
-  Done!


## Step 2: Install the CLI

Follow the instruction to [install the CLI](https://app.soluble.cloud/cli) in the sidebar.

There are more [detailed insructions](/cli) available in the documentation.

## Step 3: Run your first assessment

Enter a directory containing terraform, CloudFormation or Kubernetes manifests and run one of the following:


```
# Terraform
$ soluble tf-scan

# CloudFormation
$ soluble cfn-scan

# Kubernetes
$ soluble k8s-scan

At present the scanners that are available for use are:

For Terraform:

* checkov - `soluble tf-scan checkov`
* tfsec - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`
* terrascan - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`

For CloudFormation:

* cfn-nag - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-nag`
* cfn-python-lint - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-python-lint`
* checkov - `soluble cfn-scan checkov`

For Kubernetes:

* checkov - `soluble k8s-scan checkov`

_Note: If you are interested in seeing other assessment tools, let us know at support@soluble.ai_


To send the results to Soluble Fusion, add the `--upload` flag.  For instance:

```
$ soluble tf-scan --upload
...
```

The output will include a link to the assessment results.

### Notes

For tools that depend on a language runtime and installation (i.e. checkov, cfn-lint need python runtime) we use a containerized distribution by default. 

If you don't have docker available or prefer to use the already-installed version of the assesment tool, you can add `--tool-path <executable>`.

So to use the locally installed version of checkov:

```
# To use checkov on your PATH:

soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path checkov

# Sepecify a specific installation:

soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path /usr/local/bin/checkov
```
